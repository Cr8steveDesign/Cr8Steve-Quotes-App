The man says, 'I've always wanted to go to Hawaii, but I'm afraid of flying and I get seasick on boats. Can you build me a bridge?' The genie replies, 'That's impossible! Think of the logistics of that! How would the supports ever reach the bottom of the Pacific? Think of how much concrete...how much steel!! No, think of another wish.' The man thinks for a minute and says, 'I wish I could understand women.' The genie replies, 'Do you want two lanes or four?'",

    "A man goes into a bar and orders a drink. As he sits down, he sees a jar full of money on the counter. He asks the bartender what it's for, and the bartender says, 'We have a challenge going on. You put in $10, and if you can complete the three challenges we have, you get all the money in the jar.' The man says, 'What are the challenges?' The bartender replies, 'First, you have to drink a bottle of hot sauce without flinching. Second, there's a pitbull outside with a bad tooth. You have to pull it out. And third, there's a 90-year-old woman upstairs who has never had an orgasm. You have to give her one.' The man thinks for a moment and says, 'I'll pass on the first two, but I'll give the third one a try.' So he puts his $10 in the jar and goes upstairs. A few minutes later, he comes back down with a big smile on his face and says, 'Okay, where's the pitbull with the bad tooth?'",

The first man wishes to be rescued, and the genie sends a boat to save him. The second man wishes to be reunited with his family, and the genie transports him back home. The third man looks around and says, 'I'm lonely. I wish my friends were back here with me.'",

The woman replies, 'His name is Mr. Snuggles.' The man writes this down and then asks, 'And what does Mr. Snuggles do for a living?'",
